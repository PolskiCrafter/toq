communeevents.1.d:0 "We have had to fight for liberation for five years, five years. Many great orators, great thinkers, zealous men, great arist, brothers and sisters had to die to expel the armies of great nations. We started as a penal colony in 750 a.d.a. to which petty criminals and political enemies were sent. Only execution awaited those with serious crimes. Socialism, Anarchism and Communism gained voice in the world, large countries, frightened by this rhetoric, began to send everyone who was suspected of belonging or Supporting thoes ideologis in to the colony. Earlier to these events, the penal colony began to grow rapidly. Although there was not much land suitable for cultivation, but the one that was of the highest class. It happened that countries dug it up and transported it by ship to each other. The second thing that struck the island was the natural resources , which was in huge numbers. Many convicts were sent to work in mines and then in refineriesin in terrible conditions, and virtually zero wages. So the colony grew and cities began to rise.Huge houses of lords, merchants and caretakers were built, and tiny huts that were barely fit for the living of a worker, creating enormous slums. And after the increase in political prisoners, Idea od liberation of prioners who often ended up there for wrong reasons and were worked to death began to appear. Although the inhabitants of the colonies came from different races, they developed a bond of brotherhood and cooperation with each other. Everyone of Prisoners tried to help every prisoner. Tensions began to build up as more and more prisoners began to support the ideas of liberation and went on strike. The critical scale was broken when the peaceful protesting workers were killed, as if for disturbing their lust. It kindled the fire of revolution. On October 6, 1096, the Animal Liberation Army took the town hall in the heart of the colony, Kulksgrad. As soon as possible, the Revolutionary Council was formed which combined the Communists, Socialists and Anarchists. And the Liberation March began. After many bloody battles in 1101, the Animal Liberation Army completely recaptured the colonies and established it as an independent one, and the Rebellious Maritime troops which have gone over to the side of the rebels dominated by communist ideology formed the red fleet, which could easily repel the colony's recapture. Unfortunately, it was not the end of the fighting Tribes from the west, Spies of great nations and Extremist groups wanted to marry a Great Revolution. For two more years, the whole country was on fire and it was often unknown who was fighting whom. But thanks to perseverance and faith in our ideas, on December 31, 1013, the Revolution was over. We won. "
